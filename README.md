## üîê Authentication Flow

1. **Unauthenticated Users:**
   - Can access homepage (`/`)
   - Can sign up (`/users/sign_up`)
   - Can sign in (`/users/sign_in`)

2. **Authenticated Users:**
   - Automatically redirected to dashboard (`/dashboard`) after login
   - Can access dashboard with user information
   - Can edit profile (`/users/edit`)
   - Can sign out (redirects to homepage)

3. **Protected Routes:**
   - Dashboard requires authentication
   - Unauthenticated users are redirected to sign in page

## üìù Posts System Flow

1. **Public Access:**
   - Anyone can view published posts (`/posts`)
   - Individual published posts are publicly accessible
   - Post listing shows only published content

2. **Authenticated Users:**
   - Can create new posts (`/posts/new`)
   - Can edit their own posts (`/posts/:slug/edit`)
   - Can delete their own posts
   - Can view their own draft posts
   - Dashboard shows their recent posts

3. **Access Control:**
   - Users can only edit/delete their own posts
   - Draft posts are only visible to the author
   - Published posts are visible to everyone
   - Proper error handling for unauthorized access

4. **URL Structure:**
   - Posts use friendly URLs with slugs (e.g., `/posts/my-awesome-post`)
   - Automatic slug generation from post titles
   - SEO-friendly URLs for better discoverability
